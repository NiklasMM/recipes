# A smoky chili

This is a recipie for a smoky chili. You can use it to insert it into yourself in order to decompose it and enable yourself to not die for some more days.

You can easily make large quantities of this dish and put portions of it in the freezer. 

## Ingredients

To fill two people until they hate themselves or four until they're full, you need

* Chilies (duh!), I use dried ones you can use fresh ones. Whatever you like, I'm not your dad.
* 3 onions
* ~ 4 cloves of garlic
* 500g ground beef (this can be replaced with minced tofu or [textured vegetable protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textured_vegetable_protein) to go full vegan.)
* 2 large bell peppers
* A large can of kidney beans
* A can of corn
* About 3 cans of chopped tomatoes or tomato puree
* 0.5 liter of red wine
* A piece of dark chocolate
* Spices: Salt, pepper, cumin, paprika and oregano

## Directions

First let's talk about chilies. I use three dried chilies for this recipe. From left to right: An [Ancho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poblano), a [Chipotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipotle) which is a smoked Jalape√±o and gives this dish it's first name and finally a [Guajillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guajillo_chili). **Caution:** If you don't use a Chipotle or another smoked chili, you waive your rights to call this a smoky chili.

Let the chilis soak in the wine for a couple of hours before you start:

So let's get on with it then:

* Chop the onions and the garlic. 
* Put some oil in a large pot and bring it to heat
* First put the beef in and add onions and garlic after it changed color

* Chop the bell peppers
* When the onions are clear, you can add the bell peppers 
* Give it a good stir and let it cook for a while
* Now add the chopped tomatoes, beans, corn and wine with the chilies
* Add the spices as you see fit
* Let it cook for at least 30 min, but the longer you let it cook the better it's going to get.

* Finally put in the piece of dark chocolate, let it melt and stir it in.
* Now you can add the final touch with the spices

**Done!** Serve with any subset of rice, tortilla chips, bread, Guacamole.... or, you know, whatever you like.
