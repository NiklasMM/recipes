# Instant Ramen Upgrade

This is the recipe that started it all.
It takes a simple instant ramen package and, with some simple additions,
turns it into a proper dish.

Very easy to learn and the first step to a complete self made ramen bowl.


## Ingredients

Generally you only need the instant ramen and can add whatever you want.
To follow the recipe leading to the version shown in the picture, you need the
following ingredients:

- Two packages of instant ramen (I was hungry)
- Two eggs
- Enokitake mushrooms
- Green asparagus
- One green bell pepper
- Sesame seeds
- Spring onion


## Directions

First, soft boil the eggs.
You want the yolk to be like warm wax.
Bring enough water to a boil to submerge the eggs completely.
Stick a small hole into the round side of the eggs to prevent the shell from
breaking.
When the water is boiling, add the eggs and let them boil for 6 - 6.5 minutes.
After the time is up, refresh the eggs with cold water.
After cooling down, peel the eggs.

Then prepare the vegetables by slicing them into thin strips or whatever
shape you prefer.
Again bring water to a boil in a pot and hang a strainer over it.
The water shouldn't touch the strainer and the strainer should be made of
metal or something else heat resistant.

Prepare the ramen, following the package instructions.
This usually means cooking some water, adding spices and oil to it and adding
the ramen for a few minutes.

While the noodles are cooking, add the vegetables into the strainer and put the
lid on the pot to steam the vegetables.
The time needed might vary based on the vegetables you use and how firm you
like them but 3 minutes is a good starting point if you want firmness left.

Prepare a bowl to put everything into.
When the noodles are done, put them into the bowl together with the broth.
Then add the vegetables on top.
Cut the eggs into four pieces and add them to the bowl.
Finally slice the spring onion into fine slices and add them as decoration
together with the sesame seeds.

Serve together with chopsticks and enjoy.
