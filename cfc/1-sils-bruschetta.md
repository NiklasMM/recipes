# Preparation

1. Start with the dates:

    1.1. Slice them up

    1.2. Stuff every single one of them with goat cheese

    1.3. Wrap them in half a bacon slice each

    1.4. Put them on a baking plate (don't forget the baking sheet, this'll
         get messy!), don't put them in the oven yet.

2. Peel the tomatoes:

    2.1. Get a pot of cold water

    2.2. Get a pot of boiling water

    2.3. Slice your tomatoes on the top like [this](http://cdn-eu-cf.yottaa.net/5756da51312e5864f800023d/blog.kingarthurflour.com/v~13.3d/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/A-Better-Bruschetta-2.jpg).
         Do not cut deep into the flesh.

    2.4. Put your tomatoes into the boiling water for about 30 seconds. You
         should already see the skin peeling back.

    2.5. Put your tomatoes into the pot with cold water until they're cool so
         you can work with them.

    2.6. Slice your tomatoes into four or eight wedges and [remove the seeds](http://cdn-eu-cf.yottaa.net/5756da51312e5864f800023d/blog.kingarthurflour.com/v~13.3d/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/A-Better-Bruschetta-7.jpg?yocs=1_&yoloc=eu)
         as well as the skin, it should peel off easily.

    2.7. Cut everything into nice little cubes and put it aside for later.

3. Put the date into the oven (no pre heating needed) for about 15 to 25
   minutes. Watch them occasionally to get them as you like it. You should be
   able to complete the following steps in that time.

4. Make the pesto

    4.1. Put all pesto ingredients into the blender. Add some
         salt and pepper and other things you see fit, e.g. lettuce.

    4.2. Blenderize it!

    4.3. Mix some of pesto with the tomatoes. Save the rest for later, it goes
         well with a lot of things. You can put it into the freezer for long
         term storage as "pesto ice cubes".

5. Make the bruschetta

    5.1. Slice the ciabatta.

    5.2. Fry the ciabatta slices with some frying oil until they're nicely
         brown. Consider salting them.

    5.3. Put the tomato pesto mix on your slices and put them on the most
         beautiful plate you have. You can decorate it with some fresh coreander
         on top.

6. Get your dates out of the oven.

7. Serve everything while it's warm and enjoy!
