# Ingredients per Person

| Count | Ingredient |
|----------|---------------|
| 1         | Physalis    |

# Preparation

1. Take a plate that is way too big for a physalis.

2. Prepare the physalis

    2.1. Open up the physalis nicely.
    
    2.2. Put it right in the middle of the plate.
    
3. Serve the physalis.

This is a wonderful initial course. The minimalistic style of this course pushes
the guest to treat the ingredients and food as something special, this makes it
easier to enjoy and appreciate the meal.
